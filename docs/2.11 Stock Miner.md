# Stock Miner


## Introduction
Stock Miner is a straightforward trading approach crafted specifically for the stock market. It harnesses the power of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator alongside various entry filters. The strategy is honed to optimize each entry signal, ensuring precise decision-making, and it provides users with a detailed performance report for thorough analysis.

## Strategy Explanation
The strategy is based on a buy signal triggered when the RSI value is overbought or oversold, depending on whether the mean-reverting or trend-following type is selected. In the presence of the trend filter, the buy signal can be further filtered using a simple 200-period moving average. Beyond this filter, there are pattern filters that serve as trade filters, with various types of patterns. An example could be volatility compression. For a comprehensive list of possible patterns, please refer to the Patterns appendix.

## Usage
QStudio's STOCK MINER functionality provides various execution modes for a trading strategy using specific JSON configuration files. Here's a brief description of the provided modes:

1. **Backtest Mode:**
   ```bash
   --stock-miner [strategy_config_file.json]
   ```
Executes the strategy in backtest mode using the provided strategy configuration file in JSON format.

2. **Signal Mode:**
   ```bash
   --stock-miner [strategy_config_file.json] --signal
   ```
   Executes the strategy to generate signals, still utilizing the strategy configuration file in JSON format.

3. **Backtest Mode (explicit):**
   ```bash
   --stock-miner [strategy_config_file.json] --backtest
   ```
   This option seems to be an explicit mode for executing the strategy in backtest mode.

4. **Optimization Mode:**
   ```bash
   --stock-miner [strategy_config_file.json] --optimize
   ```
   Executes the strategy in optimization mode, using the strategy configuration file in JSON format. This might involve searching for optimal parameters for the strategy.

These options offer flexibility in executing the trading strategy in various modes, including historical testing, signal generation, parameter optimization, etc. The specific usage of each mode will depend on the user's or financial operator's requirements and objectives.

### JSON Configuration File

**Structure**
1. **Name, symbols & quantity**
   ```json
     "name": "StockMiner",
     "symbols": "ENI.MI",
     "quantity": 1000,
   ```
2. **Strategy settings**
   
   Strategy engine is RS_base, type is `mean-reverting`, is also possible to specify `trend-following`, RSI  period with leves 35 and 80 as entry signals. Also using pattern Nr.5 as trading filter and set to `false` the trend filter which is based on SMA 200 periods.
   ```json
     "strategy": {
        "type": "mean-reverting",
        "_type-comment": "Allow values: mean-reverting, trend-following",
        "engine": "RSI_base",
        "_engine_comment": "Allow values: RSI_base",
        "rsi-period": 6,
        "rsi-low-level": 35,
        "rsi-high-level": 80,
        "trend-filter": false,
        "entry-pattern": 5
   }
   ```
3. **Backtest data-range**
   ```json
    "backtest-data": {
       "from": "2000-01-01 00:00:00",
       "to": "2021-01-01 00:00:00"
     }
   ```

and finally...
4. **Optimization Section**
   If you do not want do optimize a parameter, just don't specify its tag.
   ```json
     "optimize": {
       "rsi-period": [6, 8, 2],
       "rsi-low-level": [35, 40, 5],
       "rsi-high-level": [80, 85, 5],
       "trend-filter": [false,true],
       "entry-pattern": [0, 10],
       "order_by": ["pnl", "profit_factor"]
     }
   ```

## Optimization Report

### console outout
The use of the parameter `optimize` will produce a detailed report.
The first repot is just written as an output:

### Html Report
A second report is produce in html format and saved in `output/optimization_reports/`, the html report will present features a sortable table containing all permutations of optimizations. This enables a more straightforward and intuitive evaluation for selection. Additionally, users have the option to download the JSON execution file for the chosen optimization. This functionality enhances the user experience by providing a convenient way to review and analyze different optimization scenarios and facilitating the execution of the selected optimization by offering a downloadable JSON file.

### Excel file
In addition to the HTML report, an Excel file with the same purpose will also be generated. This Excel file will be saved in the `output/optimization_reports/` directory as well. Similar to the HTML report, the Excel file will feature a sortable table listing all permutations of optimizations. This allows for an easy and intuitive evaluation for selection.


## Important note about overfitting

Optimizing strategy parameters can lead to overfitting, where the strategy becomes too tailored to historical data and may not perform well on new data. It's essential to follow a disciplined methodology to avoid overfitting and ensure the strategy's robustness. Here are some recommended external resources for guidance on parameter optimization and avoiding overfitting:

1. [Avoiding Overfitting in Trading Systems](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Overfitting-In-Trading-Systems): This article provides insights into the dangers of overfitting in trading systems and how to avoid it.

2. [Parameter Optimization in Algorithmic Trading](https://www.quantconnect.com/blog/parameter-optimization-in-algorithmic-trading): Learn about best practices for parameter optimization and the considerations to keep in mind.

3. [Introduction to Walk-Forward Analysis](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Walk-Forward-Analysis-Using-Python-and-pandas): Walk-Forward Analysis is a technique to validate the robustness of a trading strategy. This tutorial introduces the concept and demonstrates how to implement it using Python and pandas.

Always be cautious when optimizing parameters, and consider using techniques like walk-forward analysis, out-of-sample testing, and cross-validation to ensure your strategy remains effective in real-world conditions.
